 *
 * ### Exports and imports
 *
 * ```c
 * void
 * start (void)
 * {
 *   g_autoptr(GumApiResolver) resolver = gum_api_resolver_make ("module");
 *
 *   gum_api_resolver_enumerate_matches (resolver,
 *                                       "exports:libc*.so!open*",
 *                                       // case-insensitive: "exports:*!open/i"
 *                                       // imports: "imports:example.so!open*"
 *                                       instrument_c_function,
 *                                       NULL,
 *                                       NULL);
 * }
 *
 * static gboolean
 * instrument_c_function (const GumApiDetails *details,
 *                        gpointer user_data)
 * {
 *   g_print ("Found %s at %" G_GINT64_MODIFIER "x\n",
 *            details->name,
 *            details->address);
 *   // e.g.: "Found /system/lib/libc.so at 0x7fff870135c9"
 *
 *   return TRUE; // keep enumerating
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Objective-C methods
 *
 * ```c
 * void
 * start (void)
 * {
 *   g_autoptr(GumApiResolver) resolver = gum_api_resolver_make ("objc");
 *
 *   gum_api_resolver_enumerate_matches (resolver,
 *                                       "-[NSURL* *HTTP*]",
 *                                       instrument_objc_method,
 *                                       NULL,
 *                                       NULL);
 * }
 *
 * static gboolean
 * instrument_objc_method (const GumApiDetails *details,
 *                         gpointer user_data)
 * {
 *   g_print ("Found %s at %" G_GINT64_MODIFIER "x\n",
 *            details->name,
 *            details->address);
 *   // e.g.: "Found -[NSURLRequest valueForHTTPHeaderField:] at 0x7fff94183e22"
 *
 *   return TRUE; // keep enumerating
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * gum_api_resolver_make:
 * @type: (not nullable): the resolver type to make
 *
 * Creates a new resolver of the given `type`. Available resolvers:
 *
 *  - `module`: Resolves exported and imported functions of shared libraries
 *    currently loaded. Always available.
 *  - `objc`: Resolves Objective-C methods of classes currently loaded. Available
 *    on macOS and iOS in processes that have the Objective-C runtime loaded.
 *
 * The resolver will load the minimum amount of data required on creation, and
 * lazy-load the rest depending on the queries it receives. You should use the
 * same instance for a batch of queries, but recreate it for future batches to
 * avoid looking at stale data.
 *
 * Returns: (nullable) (transfer full): the newly created resolver instance
