/**
 * This API is intended for use during fuzzing scenarios such as AFL forkserver.
 * It allows for the child to feed back the addresses of instrumented blocks to
 * the parent so that the next time a child is forked from the parent, it will
 * already inherit the instrumented block rather than having to re-instrument
 * every basic block again from scratch.
 *
 * This API has the following caveats:
 *
 * 1. This API MUST be called from the thread which will be executed in the
 *    child. Since blocks are cached in the GumExecCtx which is stored on a
 *    per-thread basis and accessed through Thread Local Storage, it is not
 *    possible to prefetch blocks into the cache of another thread.
 *
 * 2. This API should be called after gum_stalker_follow_me(). It is likely that
 *    the parent will wish to call gum_stalker_deactivate() immediately after
 *    following. Subsequently, gum_stalker_activate() can be called within the
 *    child after it is forked to start stalking the thread once more. The child
 *    can then communicate newly discovered basic blocks back to the parent via
 *    inter-process communications. The parent can then call
 *    gum_stalker_prefetch() to instrument those blocks before forking the next
 *    child. As a result of the fork, the child inherits a deactivated Stalker
 *    instance, thus both parent and child should release their Stalker
 *    instances upon completion if required.
 *
 * 3. Note that gum_stalker_activate() takes a `target` pointer which is used to
 *    allow Stalker to be reactivated whilst executing in an excluded range and
 *    guarantee that the thread is followed until the “activation target”
 *    address is reached. Typically for e.g. a fuzzer the target would be the
 *    function you're about to hit with inputs. When this target isn't known,
 *    the simplest solution to this is to define an empty function (marked as
 *    non-inlineable) and then subsequently call it immediately after activation
 *    to return Stalker to its normal behavior. It is important that `target` is
 *    at the beginning of a basic block, otherwise Stalker will not detect it.
 *    Failure to do so may mean that Stalker continues to follow the thread into
 *    code which it should not, including any calls to Stalker itself. Thus care
 *    should be taken to ensure that the function is not inlined, or optimized
 *    away by the compiler.
 *
 *    __attribute__ ((noinline))
 *    static void
 *    activation_target (void)
 *    {
        // Avoid calls being optimized out
 *      asm ("");
 *    }
 *
 * 4. Note that since both parent and child have an identical Stalker instance,
 *    they each have the exact same Transformer. Since this Transformer will
 *    be used both to generate blocks to execute in the child and to prefetch
 *    blocks in the parent, care should be taken to identify in which scenario
 *    the transformer is operating. The parent will likely also transform and
 *    execute a few blocks even if it is deactivated immediately afterwards.
 *    Thus care should also be taken when any callouts are executed to determine
 *    whether they are running in the parent or child context.
 *
 * 5. For optimal performance, the recycle_count should be set to the same value
 *    as gum_stalker_get_trust_threshold(). Unless the trust threshold is set to
 *    `-1` or `0`. When adding instrumented blocks into the cache, Stalker also
 *    retains a copy of the original bytes of the code which was instrumented.
 *    When recalling blocks from the cache, this is compared in order to detect
 *    self-modifying code. If the block is the same, then the recycle_count is
 *    incremented. The trust threshold sets the limit of how many times a block
 *    should be identical (e.g. the code has not been modified) before this
 *    comparison can be omitted. Thus when prefetching, we can also set the
 *    recycle_count to control whether this comparison takes place. When the
 *    trust threshold is less than `1`, the block_recycle count has not effect.
 *
 * 6. This API does not change the trust threshold as it is a global setting
 *    which affects all Stalker sessions running on all threads.
 *
 * 7. It is inadvisable to prefetch self-modifying code blocks, since it will
 *    mean a single static instrumented block will always be used when it is
 *    executed. The detection of self-modifying code in the child is left to the
 *    user, just as the user is free to choose which blocks to prefetch by
 *    calling the API. It may also be helpful to avoid sending the same block
 *    address to be prefetched to the parent multiple times to reduce I/O
 *    required via IPC, particularly if the same block is executed multiple
 *    times. If you are fuzzing self-modifying code, then your day is probably
 *    already going badly.
 *
 * The following is provided as an example workflow for initializing a fork
 * server based fuzzer:
 *
 *    p -> setup IPC mechanism with child (e.g. pipe)
 *    p -> create custom Transformer to send address of instrumented block to
 *         parent via IPC. Transformer should be inert until latched. Callouts
 *         should still be generated as required when not latched, but should
 *         themselves be inert until latched.
 *    p -> gum_stalker_follow_me ()
 *    p -> gum_stalker_deactivate ()
 *
 *    BEGIN LOOP:
 *
 *    p -> fork ()
 *    p -> waitpid ()
 *
 *    c -> set latch to trigger Transformer (note that this affects only the
 *         child process).
 *    c -> gum_stalker_activate (activation_target)
 *    c -> activation_target ()
 *    c -> <RUN CODE UNDER TEST HERE>
 *    c -> gum_stalker_unfollow_me () or simply exit ()
 *
 *    p -> gum_stalker_set_trust_threshold (0)
 *    p -> gum_stalker_prefetch (x) (n times for each)
 *    p -> gum_stalker_set_trust_threshold (n)
 *
 *    END LOOP:
